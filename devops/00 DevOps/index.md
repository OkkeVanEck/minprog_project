# DevOps

Get acquainted with what DevOps entails by giving https://www.ibm.com/nl-en/cloud/learn/devops-a-complete-guide a quick read.
It talks about many of the concepts that make up the core of what work as a DevOps Engineer would look like.

Of course we won't be getting down to all of the nitty gritty that DevOps has to offer us, but we will have a look at most of the lifecycle concepts found in the IBM link.

* Planning: 
  * You will be giving form to an idea of your own. A service that provides you with a simple but useful task that is automated by a deployed app.

* Development: 
  * Following the ideation of your concept, you will be implementing that idea in whatever platform suits it best. Developing your app can be done on your own machine before having to upload it to your deployment environment.

* Integration: 
  * By managing a git repository both on your machine and your deployment environment you will push and pull changes into your application.

* Deployment: 
  * Your app will have to be made available over the web to be used by your and anyone else that should have access to it. Your app will be running in a container behind a webserver such as NGINX or Apache.

* Operations:
  * Time to test not only if your app works correctly, but whether the deployment is configured correctly as well! Getting it right on the first try is rare, testing is is vital importance.

* Learning:
  * Find out where your application could perform better. Analyze and investigate performance issues and plan how to fix them accordingly.
