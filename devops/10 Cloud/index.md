# Cloud

You may have heard the term 'cloud' before. Many services offer either cloud access or microservices to run in the cloud or some other hard-to-define concept that makes use of a 'cloud'. 
What it all boils down to is that the cloud is a network of connected computers that can perform a task from any machine within that network. So in the end, it's just another computer. Just one that isn't yours.

If you're keen for more information, read up on the cloud over at IBM again [here](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/cloud-computing).

## Azure Cloud

For the DevOps track you will also be using the cloud to host your application. This particualr cloud is the Microsoft Azure cloud, give [this article](https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/what-is-microsoft-azure) a read for some more in-depth info.

Then head over to [this link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/) and sign up for their student program. That'll give you access to their Azure portal and allow you to create a so-called VPS. A Virtual Private Server; that's a server (machine) hosted on their cloud network where you can run applications and eventually deploy your application to.

To expedite the process of setting up your VPS, make sure you account is setup before the first tutorial. You'll have to confirm some emails and maybe jump some hoops. Best get that out of the way early so you can start planning asap!


## Your Cloud

Of course, there is also the option of adding your own little cloud machine to the web. This can be done by setting up a Linux Server on one of your own devices that is connected to the internet. 

It is a route that requires a lot more configuration and setup, but can be much more rewarding. You would need to provide your own device however (an old desktop or laptop) that you can have running all day. Contact me in case you wish to take on this challenge!

The official [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-server#1-overview) documentation can help you get started, but guides such as [this](https://www.makeuseof.com/ubuntu-server-guide/) and [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-20-04) may prove very useful.
