# Wiki: Screencast

Record a screencast not to exceed 5 minutes in length, in which you demonstrate your project's functionality.

- Be certain that every element of the specification is demonstrated in your video. There's no need to show your code in this video, just your application in action; we'll review your code on GitHub.

- Upload that video to <https://video.uva.nl> (as unlisted or public, but not private). Here are [instructions for recording](/screencast).

- In your video's description, you must timestamp where your video demonstrates each of the seven (7) elements of the specification. This is not optional, videos without timestamps in their description will be rejected.

Below, paste the URL of your video.
