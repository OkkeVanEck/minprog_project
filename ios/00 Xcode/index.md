# Xcode

Start with installing Xcode. You can download it from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/xcode/id497799835).

> Make sure you are connected to the `eduroam` or `uva` WiFi network. Downloading Xcode via `Amsterdam Science Park` will take a very long time and is not recommended!

While this is downloading start reading about [Swift](/ios/swift)!
