# Swift

Swift is the programming language behind SwiftUI. That means we will need to learn some Swift before we get started with SwiftUI. Luckily Swift is not all that different from most imperative programming languages like C and Python. Before Swift, Apple used Objective-C
as the main language for developing applications for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS and iPadOS.
The first version of Swift was announced at [WWDC 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO7Ta0DvEWA). Since 2018 it is more popular than Objective-C.


## A Swift Tour

Start learning Swift with the [Guided Tour](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.html) you can follow the tour on the website but we highly recommend you make
use of the [Guided Tour Playground](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.playground.zip).
You don't have to experiment with every piece of code, but make sure you've seen something from every page.

> You can also open the Playground with [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) on [Mac](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/swift-playgrounds/id1496833156) or or [iPad](https://apps.apple.com/app/id908519492).

### Extra reading material

#### Closures

Closures are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code. Closures in Swift are similar to blocks in C and Objective-C and to lambdas in other programming languages.
