# Final Project: Scientific Programming

## Requirements

Here we list the **requirements** that all submitted projects should accommodate.

- *Functional requirements* define the scope of the project
- *Implementation details* make sure all projects can be graded in the same way and ensure usefulness to a broad audience
- *Process requirements* help us track your progress and help you to get a good grade

A **general requirement** is that your project may not be based on code you wrote earlier or be similar to the projects you did in this or other courses (it must be a new project) and that you cannot do a project for which the requirements will be set by a third party (the project must be done for this course and not for anyone else). You also must use data which you haven't used before in other courses, research projects, at work or otherwise.

## Functional requirements<br><small>What it should do</small>

- Your product should define an interesting problem or explain an interesting theory, and should pose a research question on this problem or theory.

- Your research question should be answered through data-analysis and data-visualisation, with clear explanation of the data, the analysis process and the results.

- You should present your conclusions on the research question in your product.

- Your product should be reasonably original with regards to other products that are available on the web these days.

- Your product should embody good interaction design practices, to help users easily navigate your product and accomplish their goals.

- Your product should allow the user to explore the data and your visualisations through several interactive elements.

## Implementation details<br><small>How it must be implemented</small>

- Your product must be written in a Jupyter notebook, or alternatively using Flask or Django and CSS as an interactive web application.

- If using a Jupyter notebook: you musn't have all your code in the main notebook. Your notebook's purpose is to _tell the story_. You can write functions in seperate Python files and import them for anything that isn't interesting to the reader.

- Your project's source code must include your name in a comment atop every source file in the project to indicate that you wrote it.

- Your product, and especially your research question and the dataset(s) used, must be sufficiently complex, as determined by the course's instructor.

- Your product must be reproducible on another computer by cloning the repository and following instructions in the `README`. Your dataset(s) must either be included or be loaded from the internet by your code.

- If creating an interactive web app: jQuery may not be used except to use standard functionality from web frameworks like Bootstrap. If you don't know what jQuery is, that's fine!

## Process requirements<br><small>What else you need to do</small>

- You must keep track of your code via git and push your code to GitHub at the end of each day.

- You must keep a process book, as explained later.

- Your product must be shown running on the final day of the course.

## A recommendation<br><small>Advice to keep in mind</small>

- Try out something new! For example, [query Wikidata with SPARQL](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/Wikidata_Query_Help), [analyse network structures with NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) or maybe [try out machine learning with Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/). It really is much more enjoyable and interesting that way. You don't have to get in too deep, just take a look at the basics and take it from there. Feel free to look for other platforms, too! There's lots out there.
